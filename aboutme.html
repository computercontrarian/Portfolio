				<h2>Background</h2>
				
				<p>Currently, I am finishing 
				up my bachelor's in cybersecurity 
				and information assurance at Western 
				Governors University. Previously, 
				I pursued an associates degree in 
				cybersecurity from Chemeketa Community 
				College and graduated with honors in 2022. 
				Before that, I worked a series of part time 
				jobs that helped prepare me for my educational 
				journey after graduating from high school in 2014.</p>
				
				<p>I am passionate about ensuring our critical
				infrastructure is safe from cyberattacks. During 
				the summer of 2022, I participated in a research 
				fellowship at Portland State Universitie's Mark 
				Hatfield School of Government. I contributed 100 
				hours of research towards securing our smart grid
				and critical infrastructures, increasing diversity,
				equity, and inclusion in the technology industry,
				and promoting best practices in cybersecurity
				for our local government entities.</p>
				
				<p>I enjoy competing in capture the flag. 
				I have competed in multiple national cyber
				league competitions and also practice my 
				skills on tryhackme.com. Competing for the
				WGU  team in the national cyber league and 
				placing 40th as a team nationally was an 
				incredible experience. I learned a lot 
				from my peers about competing in capture the flag.</p>
				
				<p>I ran a personal project website for 2 years
				and learned how to implement DNS pointers, 
				install and manage WordPress, install tls 
				certificates, and practice my web development skills.
				I am a proud owner of the CompTIA A+, Network+, and 
				Security+ certifications. I also own the CompTIA 
				Project+ certification and I am working on the Pentest+.
				It has taken a lot of time studying to obtain them. </p>
				
				<p>I am looking for junior roles in cybersecurity.
				I am open to working positions in security analyst 
				roles, pentesting, or risk assessment. I am also 
				looking for like-minded professionals that would 
				like to connect. I am excited to contribute to the
				security community!</p>
